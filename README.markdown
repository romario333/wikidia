Wikidia is a hybrid of diagramming tool and wiki. You can create good-looking UML diagrams with it in no time. Because underneath it's just human-readable text, you can edit them easily and rapidly, you can put them into the source control, merge them or do any other text-based operation.

This project is in very early phase, right now there is not much to see.
